# CPU ID <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a small proof of concept library that obtains CPU information using
native CPU instructions on x86 compatible processors, using the `cpuid`
instruction.

It can also read a specific XML format instead of querying the local processor
for offline parsing.

## 1. Features

This program is limited to querying Intel and AMD processors, as of November
2020.

It performs a register dump, or can load a previously saved register dump, and
interpret:

- the features for AMD/Intel (see [Supported Processors and
  Features](#31-supported-processors-and-features) for more information)
- the brand string/description
- CPU and Cache and Topology

It is written for Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003 and later, using .NET 4.0,
to try and target as many CPUs as possible.

## 2. Project Organization

There are 4 projects:

- A C++ library compiled with Visual Studio 2022 IDE with Windows XP
  compatibility
- A .NET Assembly reusable in other projects
- CPUID for Windows
- CPUID Console to dump CPUID data to an XML file

### 2.1. The Windows Tool

Just run the Windows application and you'll be presented a very basic view. The
first tab shows the basic CPU identification features. It shows a tree for each
CPUID node found and a break down for some of the CPUID leaves.

## 3. Programming Notes

The library supports executing a dump and setting the affinity of the current
thread to the current logical processor. You should generally however set the
affinity of the current thread to the processor you wish to detect before
executing to obtain consistent results.

### 3.1. NuGet Package

Include the NuGet package `RJCP.Diagnostics.CpuId` in all projects and dependent
projects if not including the sources direct. The NuGet package must be included
in all dependent projects in addition so that the native libraries are made
available (this is a limitation of NuGet).

### 3.2. Supported Processors and Features

Features are not shared between processors, but are derived directly from the
manufacturers documentation.

#### 3.2.1. Intel

based on [1] and [2].

- Register dumps as given in [2].

  - Processor Signature
  - Family
  - Model
  - Stepping
  - Processor Type

- Function 01h
  - Processor Signature
  - Family
  - Model
  - Stepping

    [16]
- Features from function 01h, 07h, 80000001h, 80000008h, 8000001Fh, defined in
  [6], [6a], [7], [8], [9], [10].
- Cache Topology in function 80000005h, 80000006h, 80000019h, 8000001Dh, defined
  in [6].
- CPU Topology in function 8000001Eh, defined in [6].

## 4. Further Help

It is appreciated if CPUID dumps are provided. Most online resources no longer
provide the raw CPUID data, which is essential to test this library. Many bugs
could be found by the large amount of CPUID dumps found by
[http://users.atw.hu/instlatx64/](InstLatX64) for example.
